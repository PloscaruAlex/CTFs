After I connect to the address I need to convert some numbers, first from binary to text, then from octal to text, then from hexadecimal to text. After all 
three conversions I get the flag.

I used: [rapidtables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html) for binary and hexadecimal, and [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code) for the octal conversion.
