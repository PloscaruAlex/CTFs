# Wave a flag (General Skills, 10p)
I can see that the file is an ELF, so I needed to execute it, but I don't have permission, so:
```
$chmod +x warm
```
Then I executed the file and:
```
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
```
After that I passed a -h:
```
$./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_30e77291}
```
Flag: `picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_30e77291}`
