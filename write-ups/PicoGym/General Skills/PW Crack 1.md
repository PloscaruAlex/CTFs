When I looked in the python script I saw that the user input is compared to `1e1a` so that is the password for the flag, and I ran the script in the same directory
with the encrypted file and I get the flag.
```
$python3 level1.py
Please enter correct password for flag: 1e1a
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_fa343060}
```
Flag: `picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_fa343060}`
