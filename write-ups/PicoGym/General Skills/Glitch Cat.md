If you connect to the address, it says:
```
$nc saturn.picoctf.net 51109
'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x62) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x36) + chr(0x38) + chr(0x66) + chr(0x37) + chr(0x35) + '}'
```
And if you put that in python, you get the flag.
```
$python3
>>> 'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x62) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x36) + chr(0x38) + chr(0x66) + chr(0x37) + chr(0x35) + '}'
'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_bda68f75}'
```
Flag: `picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_bda68f75}`
