After I connect to the address I need to convert some numbers, first from binary to text, then from octal to text, then from hexadecimal to text. After all 
three conversions I get the flag.

I used: [Rapidtables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html for the binary and hexadecimal), and [Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code) for the octal conversion.
