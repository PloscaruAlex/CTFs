If you look at the hint of the challenge it says something about `rockstar` so I looked up on the internet `linux rockstar`, and I found an interesting programming language
named `rockstar`. I accessed the website https://codewithrockstar.com/online and I passed the lyrics as input, and I get a bunch of number that look like ascii:
```
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
```
After I convert them I get: `rrrocknrn0113r`. I wrap it in flag format and there it is.

Flag: `picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}`
